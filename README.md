# Text Generation using LSTM and Keras (Python)

In this project, I have taken first four chapters of moby dick as my dataset and divided them into small sequences of 26 words where 25 words are used as X and one word as y. I have trained the model on these short sequences to predict the next word. Atlast, I output user provided number of words after a selected sequence. For eg. The model can predict next 5 words after a given sequence.

*Note: These results are obtained after hours of model training with different parameters. The model shared with the code is not fully optimized one so results will vary.*
